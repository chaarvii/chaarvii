- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chaarvii, Junior at BITS Pilani pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Biological Sciences 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m highly interested in Research, primarily in domains that have a flavor of both computers and biology. I wish to pursue independent research in coming future. I am looking for research opportunities and project colaborations in bioinformatics, computational biology, computational genomics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
